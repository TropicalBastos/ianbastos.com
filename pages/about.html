                    <h3>Front End Developer & Digital Design</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently a student at the University of Nottingham (unrelated degree programme, but if you really want to know – Spanish and Media)
                        But my heart is in the developer jungle, I have been coding on the front end non-commercially for many years with years of Javascript/JQuery/HTML and
                        CSS under my belt. What is front end development without some good old design specs right? So in the design world, I am proficient with
                        image manipulation, raster graphics and vector graphics with tools such as Photoshop, Inkscape and not so bad with 3d design and modelling
                        using Blender3D. All of what you see on this site is designed by me both programatically and the arty stuff. I have designed posters for
                        music bands, created t shirt concepts and all that malarkey.

                    <h3>Back End Developer & General Programmer</h3>
                    <p>I like to get dirty with databases in SQL and have built various applications that interact with databases on a server especially through PHP.
                      I'm easily adaptable to new frameworks and programming languages and always lusting for more knowledge – I am currently enjoying NodeJs and ExpressJs ;).
                      I pretty much spend my whole free time programming and I love it! If a program needs building in Java, I’ll build it, if a server needs doing in Python,
                      I’ll do it. That sense of creating something from scratch and making it work is just indescribable. There is a certain ethos when it comes to programming: have fun and
                     do your job right - thats my motto at least</p>

                    <h3>And a bit of my personal side...</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a surfer I am drawn to coastal areas like flies to light and I like to keep myself physically fit and in good shape - a healthy mind needs a healthy body, and a
                        healthy mind is always ready to dive into complicated algorithms. I also like to learn not only new programming languages but new real world languages as I currently
                        speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and I am learning Russian. I guess I just love learning, even though half of my degree was useless knowledge, yes I am referring to
                        Media as a degree programme…
